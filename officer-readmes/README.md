#Officer READMES
These files serve as instructions for future CSLUG officers whenever they may
decide to revive the club. CSLUG has a history of being active in spurts, then
dying until new students decide they'd like a Linux club again.

In order to make CSLUG's revival easier, some club officers have left
behind this set of READMEs for each membership position. Additionally, the CSLUG
website has been created to be as automated as possible in an attempt to be
functional and easy to work with with different (or no) leaders.
