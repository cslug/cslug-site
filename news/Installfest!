There's a CSLUG installfest this Friday, February 8 2013, in OCNL 241! Come by
any time between 10am and 1pm to get help installing Linux for the new semester!

The CSLUG installfest is an event we put on each semester to help new Linux
users get their machines up and running with their Linux distribution of choice.
We'll have CDs, DVDs, and USB drives on hand with all your favorite
distributions on them, so come on by and get help, help out others, or just hang
out with the usergroup!

See you there!
