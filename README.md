## cslug-site
This is the code for the website of the Chico State Linux User Group (CSLUG).
The site is new as of Spring '12; for the old site's source, check the
`2010site` branch.

The [live site][1] auto-pulls the latest commits from this repo nightly.

### Contributing
To contribute, just fork and do whatever you want, then pull request. Don't be
shy with it; if you see something that could be better, make it better and rub
it in everyone's faces afterwards for the warm fuzzies. Remember that this
is a club project -- don't make suggestions; make changes.

If you're new to git, don't be intimidated. GitHub has [very helpful
instructions][2] on forking repositories, and it's the easiest way (for both
parties) to merge contributed/fixed code.

If you're a member looking to add yourself to the site's memberlist, just fork
us, add/commit/push your member file according to [the memberlist README][3],
then submit a pull request.

### Some quick code structure bullets
* All page requests go through `index.php`, which handles headers/footers/all
  that joy.
* HTML/CSS is compartmentalized into template-esque files in `html`, which are
  eventually parsed by the `Template` class.
* The members, minutes, and news pages grab data from their respective folders
  -- see each folder's README for more info.
* This project uses [tabs for indentation and spaces for alignment][4]. You
  may want to tell your editor to visibly display tab characters (e.g.
  [vim][5]).
